Overview
########

CollatzPy is a package that lets users create tree objects that collect
Collatz sequences as defined by the popular Collatz conjecture.  The
package contains a small set of functions for saving and recalling trees as
wel as visualization tools and tree graphing.  

The package is, by and large, a simple one; more robust and powerful tools exist
for this task. But this one at the very least is simple, relatively efficient 
for storing a few million sequences, and the trees themselves are fairly
compact.  Plotting tools use matplotlib/pygraphviz and are preconfigured for 
quick and decent looking visualization.
