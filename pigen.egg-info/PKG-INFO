        Overview
        --------
        A small collection of generators and functions for digits of pi. Maybe
        you've an art or math project and need to generate a few thousand to
        a few million digits of pi?  This will help with that.
        
        
        Generators
        ----------
        
        Spigot's Algorithm | *pigen.spigot_pi*
        ======================================
        
        * spigot_pi is a generator function.
        * Useful when you only need a single digit at a time.
        * Not as fast as frac_pi but a classic...
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          from pigen import spigot_pi as spi
        
          pi_gen = spi()
          for _ in range(100): # Let's iterate through the first 100 digits of pi.
            digit = next(pi_gen)
            # do something with digit
        
        Fractional Continuation | *pigen.frac_pi*
        =========================================
        
        * frac_pi is a generator function.
        * Useful when you only need a single digit at a time.
        * Fastest single digit generator currently in the package.
        * You can pass your own lambda functions for other well behaved
          irrational numbers!
        * You can specify the base for output as well, i.e., decimal, hex, etc.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          from pigen import frac_pi as fpi
        
          pi_gen = fpi()
          for _ in range(100): # Let's iterate through the first 100 digits of pi.
            digit = next(pi_gen)
            # do something with digit
        
          # We can pass lambdas to get different transcendental numbers.
          # The golden ratio
          phi_gen = fpi(lambda a: 1, lambda b: 1, base=10)
          for _ in range(1000): # Let's iterate through the first 1000 digits of phi.
            digit = next(phi_gen)
            # do something with digit
        
        
        Chudnovsky's Binary Search | *pigen.chudnovsky_pi*
        =====================================================
        
        * chudnovsky_pi is a regular function.
        * Useful if you need many digits at once.
        * The absolute fastest across the board. If you need a million
        * digits or more, this has got you covered.
        * You need only pass the number of digits you'd like to generate.
        * Makes heavy use of gmpy2 and the associated libs.  Very fast but you may need
          to install other platform specific dependencies.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          from pigen import chudnovsky_pi as cpibs
          n = 1000000
          n_pi_digits = cpi(n) # An integer `n` digits long containing digits of pi

        0.1.2 (2020-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
        * Completely removed slower Chudnovsky function.
          It didn't generate the correct sequence.
